Each glomerulus and tubule form a nephron, the functional unit of the kidneys.
So these motor proteins attached to the microtubule ropes basically serve to spool up the tubule slack.
From here the filtrate enters the loop of Henle, which is a long hairpin shaped tubule that passes through the two main layers of the kidney.

Dynein grabs on to one end of the microtubules and pulls the tubules and chromosomes towards one end of the cell.
That action potential continues along the muscle cells membrane and then flows inside it along special folds in the membrane called T-tubules.

If any one faculty of our nature may be called more wonderful than the rest, I do think it is memory. There seems something more speakingly incomprehensible in the powers, the failures, the inequalities of memory, than in any other of our intelligences. The memory is sometimes so retentive, so serviceable, so obedient; at others, so bewildered and so weak; and at others again, so tyrannic, so beyond control! We are, to be sure, a miracle every way; but our powers of recollecting and of forgetting do seem peculiarly past finding out. (Jane Austen)

This thing was the same length and maybe the same weight as a tyrannosaur.
The name tyrannosaur means 'tyrant' and 'lizard.' Scientists also think the Guanlong wucaii was a relative of primitive bird-like dinosaurs.
Stephen Brusatte, from the American Museum of Natural History in New York, who worked on the finds said, 'Much of what we thought we knew about tyrannosaur evolution turns out to be simplistic or out and out wrong.'
Instead they seem to have been present throughout the Cretaceous period in which the tyrannosaurs, which included T-Rex, topped the food chain.
Their importance was revealed when it became clear that this was an adult dinosaur bearing all the marks of later giant tyrannosaurs but at a fraction of the size.
Polar dinosaurs include hadrosaurs, ceratopsians, tyrannosaurs, troodontids, hypsilophodontids, ankylosaurs, prosauropods, sauropods, ornithomimids and oviraptorosaurs.

On October 7, James Rothman, Randy Schekman of the United States and Thomas Suedhof of Germany were jointly awarded the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, in recognition of their discoveries of “machinery regulating vesicle traffic, a major transport system in our cells,” which is expected to give insight into diabetes and Alzheimer’s.
After neurotransmitters are synthesized and packaged into vesicles, they're transported until the vesicle reaches the membrane.
Here the membrane just folds in a little to form the beginning of a channel, and then pinches off to form a vesicle that holds the fluid.
The vesicles are not cleanly [smoothly] spherical.
Blisters or vesicles are normally caused by the foot and mouth disease virus.
These rocks can also have vesicles because of the trapping of gas bubbles in the magma as it quickly solidifies into rock.
It's called vesicular transport, and the heavy lifting is done by vesicles, which are tiny sacs made of phohpholipids, just like the cell membrane.
